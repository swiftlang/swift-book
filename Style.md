# The Book’s Structure

TSPL is divided into three main parts, plus some front matter,
which serve complementary functions:

**A Swift Tour**,
commonly referred to as “the tour”,
shows you a bunch of interesting Swift code,
but it tells you almost nothing about how the language works.
For example, the guide has an entire chapter about optional chaining,
but it’s summarized in just a few sentences in the tour.
The tour just needs to give you the syntax and a taste of how to use it;
it relies on the guide to provide the actual in-depth explanation
of how optional chaining works in general and when you should use it.

The intention of the tour is that
it can be read in its entirety in a single sitting.
A beginner will get a high-level view of what’s possible in Swift.
A reader with more programming background will learn
“enough Swift to be dangerous” — that is,
enough of the language syntax to start muddling along on a first project,
and then come back to TSPL when they’re ready to learn more than
just surface level syntax for concepts they already know from other languages.

**Language Guide**,
commonly referred to as “the guide”,
leads you through the Swift language in a pedagogically useful, linear order.
It doesn't promise to show you every feature of
the language or the Swift standard library,
and it hand-waves over the exact details
of some of the more complicated underlying bits.
The guide leans on the reference to resolve the nitty-gritty detail questions
and to exhaustively cover the language.
Unlike the reference,
it walks you through step-by-step explanations,
showing examples of the language features in action,
and it assumes very little prior knowledge.

To maintain the promise of a linear reading order
when you add new sections to the guide,
make sure that all of the syntax and concepts that you use in your explanations
are already discussed in previous chapters.
“The Basics” exists, in large part, to introduce a bunch of syntax and concepts
that the early chapters of the guide need
— many topics from “The Basics” are covered again later in the guide in more detail.

The guide includes types from the Swift standard library for two reasons:
they’re needed by an explanation of a language concept,
or they’re so common that readers wouldn’t
be able to build anything useful without them.
The latter reason includes a judgement call.
When new types are introduced in the Swift standard library,
we usually need to discuss whether & where to add them to TSPL.

The guide can be broken down into three major chunks:
basic topics, data-modeling topics, and advanced topics.
Basic topics is everything before the introduction of
enumerations, structures, and classes.
Advanced topics is everything after deinitialization.
Data modeling is the content in between.
The linear flow is intended to make sense,
even if you stop reading for a while between chunks.
For example, reading just the basic topics gives you enough information
to write programs that have only unstructured “primitive” data.
The chapters in each chunk are ordered with fundamental topics at the beginning,
and topics that most readers can skip at the end.

**Language Reference**,
commonly referred to as “the reference”,
describes every aspect of the Swift language in complete detail,
but it makes no attempt to be an instructional text.
Its material is ordered according to the shape of the formal grammar,
and it hand-waves over examples and applications.
Several places explicitly link back to the guide for examples.
It doesn't need to be as approachable for beginners,
because the guide handles that,
but it does need to be accurate and unambiguous,
shining its flashlight into infrequently explored areas of the language.
To accomplish that,
it sometimes must sacrifice approachability or user-friendliness.
That's ok — many readers won't even need the reference,
but if the reference is unclear,
the readers who need an answer have nowhere else to go.

Within the reference, sections follow a predictable four-part structure:

* A few sentences briefly describe the language construct named by the heading.
* A code outline shows its general syntactic shape.
* A few paragraphs describe it in more detail.
* A grammar formally describes the syntax.

The purpose of the formal grammar
is to be able to unambiguously answer questions of what’s valid Swift
(without commenting on meaning)
for readers whose question wasn’t fully answered by the prose in the reference.
It’s primarily aimed at human readers,
which means it’s not always suitable for generating a parser for Swift code.

# Terms and Rules

## attribute names

In the guide, write `@` before attribute names;
in the reference, omit it.

## back deploy

Spelled as two words, not closed up or hyphenated.

## compiler, the

See entry for *Swift*.

## deprecation

In the language reference,
include a deprecation note at the start of a section
that describes a deprecated feature.
Use wording and markup like the following:

```
> Deprecated:
> This attribute is deprecated;
> use the <doc:Attributes#main> attribute instead.
> In Swift 6,
> using this attribute will be an error.
```

## definite initialization

Not “definitive initialization”.
Don‘t abbreviate as DI.

## function

In the reference,
“function” includes both free functions and member functions,
so we don’t also mention methods separately.
In the guide, we write “functions and methods”.

## headings

Use number signs (`#`) for headings, not underlines.

Although level four headings are allowed and the book does use them,
you should generally try to avoid them.
Deeply nested headings often indicate
that there’s a better way to organize the content.

## macro names

In the guide,
write `@` before the name when referring to attached macros
and `#` before the name when referring to freestanding macros.
In the reference, omit it.

## memberwise initializer

Not hyphenated as “member-wise”.

## method

See entry for *function*.

## non-optional

Hyphenated to avoid the misreading as nono-ptional.
Normal rules for hyphenation from Apple Style Guide would omit the hyphen.

See also commit 51c4fbc135a5e82343a0f5d9121f8a060b59f1a3 and <rdar://problem/44881846>.

## non-asynchronous

Use “synchronous” instead of this double negation.

## operator

When introducing a named operator for the first time,
give its name followed by its symbol.
In subsequent use, use the symbol on its own.
For example:

> By default,
> custom classes and structures don’t have an implementation of
> the *equal to* operator (`==`) or *not equal to* operator (`!=`).
> You usually implement the `==` operator,
> and use the Swift standard library’s default implementation of the `!=` operator
> that negates the result of the `==` operator.
> There are two ways to implement the `==` operator.

If the operator doesn’t have an established English name,
make sure you get tech review on the name you invent for it.

## optional binding

Omit the article: "use optional binding", not "use an optional binding".

## passive voice

In general,
the writing guidance to avoid passive voice
when you could write the sentence in active still applies
because the active voice tends to be more readable.
However,
because of the subject matter in TSPL,
it’s sometimes the case that
the active form of a sentence has no meaningful subject
because the action is performed by some vague compiler-Swift-parser entity.
In that case, passive voice is sometimes the clearest way to write
a sentence whose focus is the action rather than the agent.

For example, the phrase “X is understood as Y”
appears several times in the reference
when describing the meaning of a piece of syntax.
In this case, passive voice is clearer than active
because there isn’t a clear agent performing the understanding
and the identity of that agent is irrelevant.

## potential suspension point

This is the preferred wording when describing the semantics of `await`.
If context has already made that clear and repeating “potential” becomes wordy,
you can shorten it to just “suspension point”.

## punctuation before a code listing

Write a colon after a sentence that ends with a phrase like
“as follows” or “as shown below”,
where the code listing is basically acting like a part of the sentence,
and the prose is explicitly referring to it.
Use a colon after a sentence fragment like “For example:”.
Write a period after sentences that make a statement about the code
but don’t include words that refer to the code.
Use a period for sentences that begin with a phrase like
“In the following code”.

> **Note:**
> This usage isn’t entirely consistent in the existing text.
> We should have a discussion about this with Editorial.

## runtime, run time

Apple Style Guide uses “runtime” for both
the point in time at which code is run (the run time)
and the environment in which it is being run (the runtime).
So far, because we don’t document the Swift runtime environment
in the same way that the Obj-C runtime is documented,
we haven’t needed to make this distinction.
(We don’t document the Swift runtime, in part,
because it doesn’t expose any API like the Obj-C runtime does.)
In general, because the terms are used differently,
the difference is obvious from context,
with the exception of phrases like “a run-time error” and “a runtime error”,
which refer respectively to
an error that occurs while running the code
and an error that comes from or is related to the Swift runtime environment.

## shared mutable state

Avoid when describing actors.
By design, actors specifically *avoid* having shared mutable state —
their mutable state is private,
and accessible only through the actor's (async) methods.

## standard library

Spell out in full as “the Swift standard library“ on the first use.
If context already makes it clear
and repeating the full name becomes wordy,
you can shorted it to just “the standard library”
in continued discussion.
(We currently don‘t have any examples of doing that.)

Not “stdlib“ or “the stdlib“.

## spawn, start

Use “add” instead to refer to creating a new task,
to match the API symbol name.
(These names were used in an earlier version of the SE proposal.)

## suspension point

See entry for *potential suspension point*.

## syntax outline

Use only when demonstrating the shape of a syntactic construction.
When referring to the placeholders (aka blue bubbles)
in body text that comes after the syntax outline,
italicize their name.

Syntax outlines are used very sparingly in the guide,
but extensively in the reference.

## Swift

In the guide, we use Swift as a “friendly” subject
when describing something that the compiler or the language is doing.
For example:

> Swift assumes that you are referring
> to a property or method of the current instance.
>
> Note that Swift infers a type of `String` for the `someString` constant.
>
> Swift gives you a warning if you use an optional value
> where a value of type `Any` is expected.

In the reference,
we refer to the compiler specifically
when it‘s the actual agent performing the action.
We don’t distinguish between the parts of the compiler
like the parser or the lexer or the optimizer.

## upcoming features

Starting with the implementation of
[SE-0362: Piecemeal adoption of upcoming language improvements][SE-0362],
some language features are available on an opt-in basis
before being enabled by default.

At the beginning of a section or chapter about a future feature,
include a note as follows.

> Note:
> This language feature will be part of Swift *n*.
> To enable it in current versions of Swift,
> use the feature identifier `SomeFeatureIdentifier`.
> For information about enabling future language features,
> see [Enabling future language features](FIXME).

# Tone

In general, and especially in the guide,
the writing approach should carry a sense of joy.
Examples should be easy and pleasant to read,
which means we prefer code that’s realistic
and many chapters weave a common narrative thread across multiple examples.
Although that continuous narrative connection
can make later changes more expensive,
on the whole we think it’s worth it because it makes the chapter
flow better and hang together better as a cohesive whole.

In the interest of readability and approachability,
we don’t write examples that have
single-letter or meaningless identifiers,
even in the reference and even when we‘re only describing syntax.
Instead, when there’s no relevant semantic meaning,
we use types like `SomeStructure` and variables like `someArray`.

Some of our examples include humorous references to things outside the book,
such as the joke about Firefly crew members in the guided tour.
Some of them are marked with a REFERENCE comment that explains the reference.
All of them need to be easily ignored
if you didn’t catch the reference,
and it should be easy to search for the reference online
if you noticed that there was a reference but didn’t get the joke.

Code listings in the guide typically follow a three part formula.
The paragraph before the code listing
frames the problem that we’re trying to solve
and explains what the code will do at a very high level.
The paragraph (or sometimes multiple paragraphs) after the code
walk through what the code listing did in more detail.
The intention here is essentially to provide progressive disclosure:
Advanced readers can skip the paragraph after the code listing,
and might even be able to skip some of the text before it,
but the full no-assumptions-made explanation of the code
is still available to readers who need it.

For a discussion of the balance between the tour, the guide, and the reference,
see the README file at the top level of this repository.

# Semantic Line Breaks

The markdown files in this repository use semantic line breaks,
where lines end at sentence and clause boundaries.
This keeps lines short enough to ensure that
diffs remain readable when shown in places like
pull requests,
commit notification emails,
and the terminal.
Because the lines break in meaningful places,
changes don’t require re-wrapping entire paragraphs,
so only the lines that changed get marked.
This lets tools like `git-blame` give per-line history.

As you’re writing,
aim to keep lines 80 characters or less.
Start a new line after each sentence,
and as needed at clause boundaries.
For a long list,
you can put each list item on its own line —
this is mostly helpful for lists you want to alphabetize
because it lets you sort those lines.
There are several different styles throughout the book,
so don’t feel the need to exactly follow any one approach.

When you’re editing existing text,
preserve the line breaks when feasible
to help keep the diffs small and preserve per-line history.
Don’t rewrap an existing line just because it’s too long,
unless you’re actually making other changes.
For historical reasons,
there are parts of the book
that use a line length of 90 or 100 characters;
rewrapping them just for the sake of line length
would make history harder to follow and create a bunch of noisy diffs.

As a historical note,
“UNIX for Beginners” by Brian W. Kernighan in 1974
is possibly the origin of this approach.
Page 11 has the following guidance
in the section *Hints for Preparing Documents*:

> Most documents go through several versions
> (always more than you expected)
> before they are finally finished.
> Accordingly,
> you should do whatever possible to make the job of changing them easy.
>
> First,
> when you do the purely mechanical operations of typing,
> type so that subsequent editing will be easy.
> Start each sentence on a new line.
> Make lines short, and break lines at natural places,
> such as after commas and semicolons,
> rather than randomly.
> Since most people change documents by rewriting phrases
> and adding, deleting and rearranging sentences,
> these precautions simplify any editing you have to do later.

Although this guidance was originally written in the context of
preparing `nroff` and `troff` files
using the line editor `ed(1)` on a paper teletype,
it continues to hold up well today
because Git and other programming tools
still generally expect text to be made up of lines of <80 characters.

# Formal Grammar

These guidelines apply to the “Grammar of X” blocks in the reference.

**Write an ASCII arrow.**
The arrow (`-->`) can be read as “can consist of.”

To make the arrow in RST, use two hyphens (`-`) followed by a right-hand angle bracket (`>`).
The production path is responsible for making it render as a nice Unicode arrow.

**Write literals with double backticks.**
For example:

    forty-two --> ``42``

**Write syntactic category names without any extra markup.**
Within a syntax-grammar block, they appear in italics automatically.
Don’t refer to them from the English prose above them.

**Use full English words as the names for syntactic categories.**
There are cases where this isn’t feasible because of space considerations.
For example, in the grammar for a C-style for statement,
the category that defines the initialization part of the for statement
had to be shortened to *for-init*
(instead of *for-initialization*, as the rule specifies).
In this case, nothing seems lost from a readability or pedagogical perspective.

    c-style-for-statement --> ``for`` for-init-OPT ``;`` expression-OPT ``;`` basic-expression-OPT brace-item-list
    c-style-for-statement --> ``for`` ``(`` for-init-OPT ``;`` expression-OPT ``;`` basic-expression-OPT ``)`` brace-item-list

    for-init --> variable-declaration | expression

**Use a pipe (`|`) to indicate alternation.**
When there are too many alternatives
to fit on a single line, use a new line for each alternative.
Don’t mix pipes and newlines.

For example, to specify that a *case-block-item* can consist of a *declaration*,
*expression*, or a *statement*, you can use a pipe instead of a new line,
because all three alternatives fit nicely on one line:

    code-block-item --> declaration | expression | statement

When using pipes,
keep the number of items in each alternative small for readability.
The most common case is that each alternative is either
a single literal or a single syntactic category,
although that's not always possible.

On the other hand, consider the grammar of a control transfer statement:

    control-transfer-statement --> break-statement
    control-transfer-statement --> continue-statement
    control-transfer-statement --> fallthrough-statement
    control-transfer-statement --> return-statement

There likely wouldn’t be room on a single line to use a pipe to separate each alternative.
The following tends not to look good:

    control-transfer-statement --> break-statement | continue-statement | fallthrough-statement | return-statement

**Append `-OPT` to indicate optionality.**
Within a syntax-grammar block,
this is translated to a subscript “opt” automatically.

**Use plural names for repetition.**
In BNF, this is represented with a plus (`+`) or star (`*`).
The syntax of our formal grammar doesn’t include repetition operators,
so we use two syntactic categories to allow repetition.
For example:

    categories --> category categories-OPT
    category --> More formal grammar goes here.

    switch-statement --> ``switch`` basic-expression { switch-cases-OPT }
    switch-cases --> switch-case switch-cases-OPT
    switch-case --> case-label statements
    switch-case --> default-label statements
    switch-case --> conditional-switch-case

A plural name consists of only a repeated list of the singular version.
If you need separators like commas, call it a “list”.

    case-label --> attributes-OPT ``case`` case-item-list ``:``
    case-item-list --> pattern where-clause-OPT | pattern where-clause-OPT ``,`` case-item-list

As shown above, use right-recursion when dealing with repetition.

**Omit grouping parentheses.**
Our formal grammar doesn’t use grouping parentheses.
Optionality using `-OPT` always applies to exactly one token before it,
and only one level of alternation using `|` or line breaks is allowed.

If you see BNF grammar for new language features that uses parentheses,
you need to exercise some creativity and judgment when removing them.

For example,
translating this part of a BNF rule required coming up with a new category,
which then needed to be defined:

    ('where' expr)?

It became:

    guard-expression-OPT
    guard-expression --> ``where`` expression

This BNF rule was a bit dense and required the application of several of the rules above:

    stmt-switch-case ::= (case-label+ | default-label) brace-item*

It became:

    switch-case --> case-labels brace-items-OPT | default-label brace-items-OPT
