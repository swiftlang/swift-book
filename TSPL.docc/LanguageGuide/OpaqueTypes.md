# Opaque and Boxed Protocol Types

Hide implementation details about a value's type.

Swift provides two ways to hide details about a value's type:
opaque types and boxed protocol types.
Hiding type information
is useful at boundaries between
a module and code that calls into the module,
because the underlying type of the return value can remain private.

A function or method that returns an opaque type
hides its return value's type information.
Instead of providing a concrete type as the function's return type,
the return value is described in terms of the protocols it supports.
Opaque types preserve type identity ---
the compiler has access to the type information,
but clients of the module don't.

A boxed protocol type can store an instance of any type
that conforms to the given protocol.
Boxed protocol types don't preserve type identity ---
the value's specific type isn't known until runtime,
and it can change over time as different values are stored.

## The Problem that Opaque Types Solve

For example,
suppose you're writing a module that draws ASCII art shapes.
The basic characteristic of an ASCII art shape
is a `draw()` function that returns the string representation of that shape,
which you can use as the requirement for the `Shape` protocol:

```swift
protocol Shape {
    func draw() -> String
}

struct Triangle: Shape {
    var size: Int
    func draw() -> String {
       var result: [String] = []
       for length in 1...size {
           result.append(String(repeating: "*", count: length))
       }
       return result.joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}
let smallTriangle = Triangle(size: 3)
print(smallTriangle.draw())
// *
// **
// ***
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> protocol Shape {
         func draw() -> String
     }

  -> struct Triangle: Shape {
        var size: Int
        func draw() -> String {
            var result: [String] = []
            for length in 1...size {
                result.append(String(repeating: "*", count: length))
            }
            return result.joined(separator: "\n")
        }
     }
  -> let smallTriangle = Triangle(size: 3)
  -> print(smallTriangle.draw())
  </ *
  </ **
  </ ***
  ```
-->

You could use generics to implement operations like flipping a shape vertically,
as shown in the code below.
However, there's an important limitation to this approach:
The flipped result exposes the exact generic types
that were used to create it.

```swift
struct FlippedShape<T: Shape>: Shape {
    var shape: T
    func draw() -> String {
        let lines = shape.draw().split(separator: "\n")
        return lines.reversed().joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}
let flippedTriangle = FlippedShape(shape: smallTriangle)
print(flippedTriangle.draw())
// ***
// **
// *
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> struct FlippedShape<T: Shape>: Shape {
         var shape: T
         func draw() -> String {
             let lines = shape.draw().split(separator: "\n")
             return lines.reversed().joined(separator: "\n")
         }
     }
  -> let flippedTriangle = FlippedShape(shape: smallTriangle)
  -> print(flippedTriangle.draw())
  </ ***
  </ **
  </ *
  ```
-->

This approach to defining a `JoinedShape<T: Shape, U: Shape>` structure
that joins two shapes together vertically, like the code below shows,
results in types like `JoinedShape<Triangle, FlippedShape<Triangle>>`
from joining a triangle with a flipped triangle.

```swift
struct JoinedShape<T: Shape, U: Shape>: Shape {
    var top: T
    var bottom: U
    func draw() -> String {
       return top.draw() + "\n" + bottom.draw()
    }
}
let joinedTriangles = JoinedShape(top: smallTriangle, bottom: flippedTriangle)
print(joinedTriangles.draw())
// *
// **
// ***
// ***
// **
// *
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> struct JoinedShape<T: Shape, U: Shape>: Shape {
        var top: T
        var bottom: U
        func draw() -> String {
            return top.draw() + "\n" + bottom.draw()
        }
     }
  -> let joinedTriangles = JoinedShape(top: smallTriangle, bottom: flippedTriangle)
  -> print(joinedTriangles.draw())
  </ *
  </ **
  </ ***
  </ ***
  </ **
  </ *
  ```
-->

Exposing detailed information about the creation of a shape
allows types that aren't meant to be
part of the ASCII art module's public interface
to leak out because of the need to state the full return type.
The code inside the module
could build up the same shape in a variety of ways,
and other code outside the module
that uses the shape shouldn't have to account for
the implementation details about the list of transformations.
Wrapper types like `JoinedShape` and `FlippedShape`
don't matter to the module's users,
and they shouldn't be visible.
The module's public interface
consists of operations like joining and flipping a shape,
and those operations return another `Shape` value.

## Returning an Opaque Type

You can think of an opaque type like being the reverse of a generic type.
Generic types let the code that calls a function
pick the type for that function's parameters and return value
in a way that's abstracted away from the function implementation.
For example, the function in the following code
returns a type that depends on its caller:

```swift
func max<T>(_ x: T, _ y: T) -> T where T: Comparable { ... }
```

<!--
  From https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1538951-max
  Not test code because it won't actually compile
  and there's nothing to meaningfully test.
-->

The code that calls `max(_:_:)` chooses the values for `x` and `y`,
and the type of those values determines the concrete type of `T`.
The calling code can use any type
that conforms to the `Comparable` protocol.
The code inside the function is written in a general way
so it can handle whatever type the caller provides.
The implementation of `max(_:_:)` uses only functionality
that all `Comparable` types share.

Those roles are reversed for a function with an opaque return type.
An opaque type lets the function implementation
pick the type for the value it returns
in a way that's abstracted away from the code that calls the function.
For example, the function in the following example returns a trapezoid
without exposing the underlying type of that shape.

```swift
struct Square: Shape {
    var size: Int
    func draw() -> String {
        let line = String(repeating: "*", count: size)
        let result = Array<String>(repeating: line, count: size)
        return result.joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}

func makeTrapezoid() -> some Shape {
    let top = Triangle(size: 2)
    let middle = Square(size: 2)
    let bottom = FlippedShape(shape: top)
    let trapezoid = JoinedShape(
        top: top,
        bottom: JoinedShape(top: middle, bottom: bottom)
    )
    return trapezoid
}
let trapezoid = makeTrapezoid()
print(trapezoid.draw())
// *
// **
// **
// **
// **
// *
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> struct Square: Shape {
         var size: Int
         func draw() -> String {
             let line = String(repeating: "*", count: size)
             let result = Array<String>(repeating: line, count: size)
             return result.joined(separator: "\n")
         }
     }

  -> func makeTrapezoid() -> some Shape {
         let top = Triangle(size: 2)
         let middle = Square(size: 2)
         let bottom = FlippedShape(shape: top)
         let trapezoid = JoinedShape(
             top: top,
             bottom: JoinedShape(top: middle, bottom: bottom)
         )
         return trapezoid
     }
  -> let trapezoid = makeTrapezoid()
  -> print(trapezoid.draw())
  </ *
  </ **
  </ **
  </ **
  </ **
  </ *
  ```
-->

The `makeTrapezoid()` function in this example
declares its return type as `some Shape`;
as a result, the function
returns a value of some given type that conforms to the `Shape` protocol,
without specifying any particular concrete type.
Writing `makeTrapezoid()` this way lets it express
the fundamental aspect of its public interface ---
the value it returns is a shape ---
without making the specific types that the shape is made from
a part of its public interface.
This implementation uses two triangles and a square,
but the function could be rewritten to draw a trapezoid
in a variety of other ways
without changing its return type.

This example highlights the way that an opaque return type
is like the reverse of a generic type.
The code inside `makeTrapezoid()` can return any type it needs to,
as long as that type conforms to the `Shape` protocol,
like the calling code does for a generic function.
The code that calls the function needs to be written in a general way,
like the implementation of a generic function,
so that it can work with any `Shape` value
that's returned by `makeTrapezoid()`.

You can also combine opaque return types with generics.
The functions in the following code both return a value
of some type that conforms to the `Shape` protocol.

```swift
func flip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}
func join<T: Shape, U: Shape>(_ top: T, _ bottom: U) -> some Shape {
    JoinedShape(top: top, bottom: bottom)
}

let opaqueJoinedTriangles = join(smallTriangle, flip(smallTriangle))
print(opaqueJoinedTriangles.draw())
// *
// **
// ***
// ***
// **
// *
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> func flip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
         return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
     }
  -> func join<T: Shape, U: Shape>(_ top: T, _ bottom: U) -> some Shape {
         JoinedShape(top: top, bottom: bottom)
     }

  -> let opaqueJoinedTriangles = join(smallTriangle, flip(smallTriangle))
  -> print(opaqueJoinedTriangles.draw())
  </ *
  </ **
  </ ***
  </ ***
  </ **
  </ *
  ```
-->

The value of `opaqueJoinedTriangles` in this example
is the same as `joinedTriangles` in the generics example
in the <doc:OpaqueTypes#The-Problem-that-Opaque-Types-Solve> section earlier in this chapter.
However, unlike the value in that example,
`flip(_:)` and `join(_:_:)` wrap the underlying types
that the generic shape operations return
in an opaque return type,
which prevents those types from being visible.
Both functions are generic because the types they rely on are generic,
and the type parameters to the function
pass along the type information needed by `FlippedShape` and `JoinedShape`.

If a function with an opaque return type
returns from multiple places,
all of the possible return values must have the same type.
For a generic function,
that return type can use the function's generic type parameters,
but it must still be a single type.
For example,
here's an *invalid* version of the shape-flipping function
that includes a special case for squares:

```swift
func invalidFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
    if shape is Square {
        return shape // Error: return types don't match
    }
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape) // Error: return types don't match
}
```

<!--

  >> }
  -> func invalidFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
         if shape is Square {
             return shape // Error: return types don't match
         }
         return FlippedShape(shape: shape) // Error: return types don't match
     }
  !$ error: function declares an opaque return type 'some Shape', but the return statements in its body do not have matching underlying types

  !!      ^                                    ~~~~~~~~~~
  !$ note: return statement has underlying type 'T'
  !! return shape // Error: return types don't match
  !! ^
  !$ note: return statement has underlying type 'FlippedShape<T>'
  !! return FlippedShape(shape: shape) // Error: return types don't match
  !! ^
  ```
-->

If you call this function with a `Square`, it returns a `Square`;
otherwise, it returns a `FlippedShape`.
This violates the requirement to return values of only one type
and makes `invalidFlip(_:)` invalid code.
One way to fix `invalidFlip(_:)` is to move the special case for squares
into the implementation of `FlippedShape`,
which lets this function always return a `FlippedShape` value:

```swift
struct FlippedShape<T: Shape>: Shape {
    var shape: T
    func draw() -> String {
        if shape is Square {
           return shape.draw()
        }
        let lines = shape.draw().split(separator: "\n")
        return lines.reversed().joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}
```

<!--

  ```swifttest
  >> protocol Shape { func draw() -> String }
  >> struct Square: Shape {
  >>     func draw() -> String { return "#" }  // stub implementation
  >> }
  -> struct FlippedShape<T: Shape>: Shape {
         var shape: T
         func draw() -> String {
             if shape is Square {
                return shape.draw()
             }
             let lines = shape.draw().split(separator: "\n")
             return lines.reversed().joined(separator: "\n")
         }
     }
  ```
-->

<!--
  Another way to fix it is with type erasure.
  Define a wrapper called AnyShape,
  and wrap whatever shape you created inside invalidFlip(_:)
  before returning it.
  That example is long enough that it breaks the flow here.
-->

The requirement to always return a single type
doesn't prevent you from using generics in an opaque return type.
Here's an example of a function that incorporates its type parameter
into the underlying type of the value it returns:

```swift
func `repeat`<T: Shape>(shape: T, count: Int) -> some Collection {
    return Array<T>(repeating: shape, count: count)
}
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> func `repeat`<T: Shape>(shape: T, count: Int) -> some Collection {
         return Array<T>(repeating: shape, count: count)
     }
  ```
-->

In this case,
the underlying type of the return value
varies depending on `T`:
Whatever shape is passed it,
`repeat(shape:count:)` creates and returns an array of that shape.
Nevertheless,
the return value always has the same underlying type of `[T]`,
so it follows the requirement that functions with opaque return types
must return values of only a single type.

## Boxed Protocol Types

A boxed protocol type is also sometimes called an *existential type*,
which comes from the phrase
"there exists a type *T* such that *T* conforms to the protocol".
To make a boxed protocol type,
write `any` before the name of a protocol (or protocol composition).
Here's an example:

```swift
struct VerticalShapes: Shape {
    var shapes: [any Shape]
    func draw() -> String {
        return shapes.map { $0.draw() }.joined(separator: "\n\n")
    }
}

let largeTriangle = Triangle(size: 5)
let largeSquare = Square(size: 5)
let vertical = VerticalShapes(shapes: [largeTriangle, largeSquare])
print(vertical.draw())
```

<!--
  - test: `boxed-protocol-types`

  ```swifttest
   >> protocol Shape {
   >>    func draw() -> String
   >> }
   >> struct Triangle: Shape {
   >>    var size: Int
   >>    func draw() -> String {
   >>        var result: [String] = []
   >>        for length in 1...size {
   >>            result.append(String(repeating: "*", count: length))
   >>        }
   >>        return result.joined(separator: "\n")
   >>    }
   >> }
   >> struct Square: Shape {
   >>     var size: Int
   >>     func draw() -> String {
   >>         let line = String(repeating: "*", count: size)
   >>         let result = Array<String>(repeating: line, count: size)
   >>         return result.joined(separator: "\n")
   >>     }
   >
   -> struct VerticalShapes: Shape {
          var shapes: [any Shape]
          func draw() -> String {
              return shapes.map { $0.draw() }.joined(separator: "\n\n")
          }
      }
   ->
   -> let largeTriangle = Triangle(size: 5)
   -> let largeSquare = Square(size: 5)
   -> let vertical = VerticalShapes(shapes: [largeTriangle, largeSquare])
   -> print(vertical.draw())
   << *
   << **
   << ***
   << ****
   << *****
   <<-
   << *****
   << *****
   << *****
   << *****
   << *****
  ```
-->

In the example above,
`VerticalShapes` declares the type of `shapes` as `[any Shape]` ---
an array of boxed `Shape` elements.
Each element in the array can be a different type,
and each of those types must conform to the `Shape` protocol.
To support this runtime flexibility,
Swift adds a level of indirection when necessary ---
this indirection is called a *box*,
and it has a performance cost.

Within the `VerticalShapes` type,
the code can use methods, properties, and subscripts
that are required by the `Shape` protocol.
For example, the `draw()` method of `VerticalShapes`
calls the `draw()` method on each element of the array.
This method is available because `Shape` requires a `draw()` method.
In contrast,
trying to access the `size` property of the triangle,
or any other properties or methods that aren't required by `Shape`,
produces an error.

Contrast the three types you could use for `shapes`:

- Using generics,
  by writing `struct VerticalShapes<S: Shape>` and `var shapes: [S]`,
  makes an array whose elements are some specific shape type,
  and where the identity of that specific type
  is visible to any code that interacts with the array.

- Using an opaque type,
  by writing `var shapes: [some Shape]`,
  makes an array whose elements are some specific shape type,
  and where that specific type's identity is hidden.

- Using a boxed protocol type,
  by writing `var shapes: [any Shape]`,
  makes an array that can store elements of different types,
  and where those types' identities are hidden.

In this case,
a boxed protocol type is the only approach
that lets callers of `VerticalShapes` mix different kinds of shapes together.

You can use an `as` cast
when you know the underlying type of a boxed value.
For example:

```swift
if let downcastTriangle = vertical.shapes[0] as? Triangle {
    print(downcastTriangle.size)
}
// Prints "5"
```

For more information, see <doc:TypeCasting#Downcasting>.

### Existential Of Protocol Composition

An existential can also creating by writing `any` before a protocol composition type (see <doc:Protocols#Protocol-Composition>). This creates a box which holds a structure, class or enum that conforms to all the protocols listed.

```
protocol Named {
    var name: String { get }
}
protocol Aged {
    var age: Int { get }
}
struct Person: Named, Aged {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
struct Dog: Named, Aged {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var breed: String
}
var family: [any (Name & Aged)]
```

## Differences Between Opaque Types and Boxed Protocol Types

Returning an opaque type looks very similar
to using a boxed protocol type as the return type of a function,
but these two kinds of return type differ in
whether they preserve type identity.
An opaque type refers to one specific type,
although the caller of the function isn't able to see which type;
a boxed protocol type can refer to any type that conforms to the protocol.
Generally speaking,
boxed protocol types give you more flexibility
about the underlying types of the values they store,
and opaque types let you make stronger guarantees
about those underlying types.

For example,
here's a version of `flip(_:)`
that uses a boxed protocol type as its return type
instead of an opaque return type:

```swift
func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result-existential-error`

  ```swifttest
  >> protocol Shape {
  >>     func draw() -> String
  >> }
  >> struct Triangle: Shape {
  >>     var size: Int
  >>     func draw() -> String { return "#" }  // stub implementation
  >> }
  >> struct Square: Shape {
  >>     var size: Int
  >>     func draw() -> String { return "#" }  // stub implementation
  >> }
  >> struct FlippedShape<T: Shape>: Shape {
  >>     var shape: T
  >>     func draw() -> String { return "#" } // stub implementation
  >> }
  -> func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
        return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
     }
  ```
-->

This version of `protoFlip(_:)`
has the same body as `flip(_:)`,
and it always returns a value of the same type.
Unlike `flip(_:)`,
the value that `protoFlip(_:)` returns isn't required
to always have the same type ---
it just has to conform to the `Shape` protocol.
Put another way,
`protoFlip(_:)` makes a much looser API contract with its caller
than `flip(_:)` makes.
It reserves the flexibility to return values of multiple types:

```swift
func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
    if shape is Square {
        return shape
    }

    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result-existential-error`

  ```swifttest
  -> func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
        if shape is Square {
           return shape
        }

        return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
     }
  !$ error: invalid redeclaration of 'protoFlip'
  !! func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
  !!      ^
  !$ note: 'protoFlip' previously declared here
  !! func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
  !!      ^
  ```
-->

The revised version of the code returns
an instance of `Square` or an instance of `FlippedShape`,
depending on what shape is passed in.
Two flipped shapes returned by this function
might have completely different types.
Other valid versions of this function could return values of different types
when flipping multiple instances of the same shape.
The less specific return type information from `protoFlip(_:)` means that
many operations that depend on type information
aren't available on the returned value.
For example, it's not possible to write an `==` operator
comparing results returned by this function.

```swift
let protoFlippedTriangle = protoFlip(smallTriangle)
let sameThing = protoFlip(smallTriangle)
protoFlippedTriangle == sameThing  // Error
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result-existential-error`

  ```swifttest
  >> let smallTriangle = Triangle(size: 3)
  -> let protoFlippedTriangle = protoFlip(smallTriangle)
  -> let sameThing = protoFlip(smallTriangle)
  -> protoFlippedTriangle == sameThing  // Error
  !$ error: binary operator '==' cannot be applied to two 'any Shape' operands
  !! protoFlippedTriangle == sameThing  // Error
  !! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~
  ```
-->

The error on the last line of the example occurs for several reasons.
The immediate issue is that the `Shape` doesn't include an `==` operator
as part of its protocol requirements.
If you try adding one, the next issue you'll encounter
is that the `==` operator needs to know
the types of its left-hand and right-hand arguments.
This sort of operator usually takes arguments of type `Self`,
matching whatever concrete type adopts the protocol,
but adding a `Self` requirement to the protocol
doesn't allow for the type erasure that happens
when you use the protocol as a type.

Using a boxed protocol type as the return type for a function
gives you the flexibility to return any type that conforms to the protocol.
However, the cost of that flexibility
is that some operations aren't possible on the returned values.
The example shows how the `==` operator isn't available ---
it depends on specific type information
that isn't preserved by using a boxed protocol type.

Another problem with this approach is that the shape transformations don't nest.
The result of flipping a triangle is a value of type `Shape`,
and the `protoFlip(_:)` function takes an argument
of some type that conforms to the `Shape` protocol.
However, a value of a boxed protocol type doesn't conform to that protocol;
the value returned by `protoFlip(_:)` doesn't conform to `Shape`.
This means code like `protoFlip(protoFlip(smallTriangle))`
that applies multiple transformations is invalid
because the flipped shape isn't a valid argument to `protoFlip(_:)`.

In contrast,
opaque types preserve the identity of the underlying type.
Swift can infer associated types,
which lets you use an opaque return value
in places where a boxed protocol type can't be used as a return value.
For example,
here's a version of the `Container` protocol from <doc:Generics>:

```swift
protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    var count: Int { get }

You can't use `Container` as the return type of a function
because that protocol has an associated type.
You also can't use it as constraint in a generic return type
because there isn't enough information outside the function body
to infer what the generic type needs to be.

```swift
// Error: Protocol with associated types can't be used as a return type.
func makeProtocolContainer<T>(item: T) -> Container {
    return [item]
}

// Error: Not enough information to infer C.
func makeProtocolContainer<T, C: Container>(item: T) -> C {
    return [item]
}
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result-existential-error`

  ```swifttest
  // Error: Protocol with associated types can't be used as a return type.
  -> func makeProtocolContainer<T>(item: T) -> Container {
         return [item]
     }

  // Error: Not enough information to infer C.
  -> func makeProtocolContainer<T, C: Container>(item: T) -> C {
         return [item]
     }
  !$ error: use of protocol 'Container' as a type must be written 'any Container'
  !! func makeProtocolContainer<T>(item: T) -> Container {
  !!                                           ^~~~~~~~~
  !! any Container
  !$ error: cannot convert return expression of type '[T]' to return type 'C'
  !! return [item]
  !! ^~~~~~
  !! as! C
  ```
-->

Using the opaque type `some Container` as a return type
expresses the desired API contract --- the function returns a container,
but declines to specify the container's type:

```swift
func makeOpaqueContainer<T>(item: T) -> some Container {
    return [item]
}
let opaqueContainer = makeOpaqueContainer(item: 12)
let twelve = opaqueContainer[0]
print(type(of: twelve))
// Prints "Int"
```

<!--
  - test: `opaque-result`

  ```swifttest
  -> func makeOpaqueContainer<T>(item: T) -> some Container {
         return [item]
     }
  -> let opaqueContainer = makeOpaqueContainer(item: 12)
  -> let twelve = opaqueContainer[0]
  -> print(type(of: twelve))
  <- Int
  ```
-->

The type of `twelve` is inferred to be `Int`,
which illustrates the fact that type inference works with opaque types.
In the implementation of `makeOpaqueContainer(item:)`,
the underlying type of the opaque container is `[T]`.
In this case, `T` is `Int`,
so the return value is an array of integers
and the `Item` associated type is inferred to be `Int`.
The subscript on `Container` returns `Item`,
which means that the type of `twelve` is also inferred to be `Int`.

  TODO: Expansion for the future

  You can combine the flexibility of returning a value of protocol type
  with the API-boundary enforcement of opaque types
  by using type erasure
  like the Swift standard library uses in the
  `AnySequence <//apple_ref/fake/AnySequence`_ type.

  protocol P { func f() -> Int }

  struct AnyP: P {
      var p: P
      func f() -> Int { return p.f() }
  }

  struct P1 {
      func f() -> Int { return 100 }
  }
  struct P2 {
      func f() -> Int { return 200 }
  }

  func opaque(x: Int) -> some P {
      let result: P
      if x > 100 {
          result = P1()
      }  else {
          result = P2()
      }
      return AnyP(p: result)
  }
-->


## Opaque Parameter Types

In addition to writing `some` to return an opaque type,
you can also write `some` in the type for a parameter
to a function, subscript, or initializer.
However, when you write `some` in a parameter type
that's just a shorter syntax for generics, not an opaque type.
For example,
both of the functions below are equivalent:

```swift
func drawTwiceGeneric<SomeShape: Shape>(_ shape: SomeShape) -> String {
    let drawn = shape.draw()
    return drawn + "\n" + drawn
}

func drawTwiceSome(_ shape: some Shape) -> String {
    let drawn = shape.draw()
    return drawn + "\n" + drawn
}
```

The `drawTwiceGeneric(_:)` function
declares a generic type parameter named `SomeShape`,
with a constraint that requires `SomeShape` to conform to the `Shape` protocol.
The `drawTwiceSome(_:)` function
uses the type `some Shape` for its argument.
This creates a new, unnamed generic type parameter for the function
with a constraint that requires the type to conform to the `Shape` protocol.
Because the generic type doesn't have a name,
you can't refer to that type elsewhere in the function.

If you write `some` before more than one parameter's type,
each of the generic types are independent.
For example:

```swift
func combine(shape s1: some Shape, with s2: some Shape) -> String {
    return s1.draw() + "\n" + s2.draw()
}

combine(smallTriangle, trapezoid)
```

In the `combine(shape:with:)` function,
the types of the first and second parameter
must both conform to the `Shape` protocol,
but there's no constraint that requires them to be the same type.
When you call `combine(shape:with)`,
you can pass two different shapes ---
in this case, one triangle and one trapezoid.

Unlike the syntax for named generic type parameters,
described in <doc:Generics> chapter,
this lightweight syntax can't include
a generic `where` clause or any same-type (`==`) constraints.
In addition,
using the lightweight syntax for very complex constraints
can be hard to read.
