- Added a note to the <doc:AccessControl#Access-Levels> section
  with information about the scope of `private` access.
- Added a note to the
  <doc:AutomaticReferenceCounting#Weak-References>
  section about the differences in weak references
  between garbage collected systems and ARC.
- Updated the
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Special-Characters-in-String-Literals> section
  with a more precise definition of Unicode scalars.

**2015-04-08**

- Updated for Swift 1.2.
- Swift now has a native `Set` collection type.
  For more information, see <doc:CollectionTypes#Sets>.
- `@autoclosure` is now an attribute of the parameter declaration,
  not its type.
  There's also a new `@noescape` parameter declaration attribute.
  For more information, see <doc:Attributes#Declaration-Attributes>.
- Type methods and properties now use the `static` keyword
  as a declaration modifier.
  For more information see <doc:Declarations#Type-Variable-Properties>.
- Swift now includes the `as?` and `as!` failable downcast operators.
  For more information,
  see <doc:Protocols#Checking-for-Protocol-Conformance>.
- Added a new guide section about
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters#String-Indices>.
- Removed the overflow division (`&/`) and
  overflow remainder (`&%`) operators
  from <doc:AdvancedOperators#Overflow-Operators>.
- Updated the rules for constant and
  constant property declaration and initialization.
  For more information, see <doc:Declarations#Constant-Declaration>.
- Updated the definition of Unicode scalars in string literals.
  See <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Special-Characters-in-String-Literals>.
- Updated <doc:BasicOperators#Range-Operators> to note that
  a half-open range with the same start and end index will be empty.
- Updated <doc:Closures#Closures-Are-Reference-Types> to clarify
  the capturing rules for variables.
- Updated <doc:AdvancedOperators#Value-Overflow> to clarify
  the overflow behavior of signed and unsigned integers
- Updated <doc:Declarations#Protocol-Declaration> to clarify
  protocol declaration scope and members.
- Updated <doc:AutomaticReferenceCounting#Defining-a-Capture-List>
  to clarify the syntax for
  weak and unowned references in closure capture lists.
- Updated <doc:LexicalStructure#Operators> to explicitly mention
  examples of supported characters for custom operators,
  such as those in the Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Symbols,
  and Dingbats Unicode blocks.
- Constants can now be declared without being initialized
  in local function scope.
  They must have a set value before first use.
  For more information, see <doc:Declarations#Constant-Declaration>.
- In an initializer, constant properties can now only assign a value once.
  For more information,
  see <doc:Initialization#Assigning-Constant-Properties-During-Initialization>.
- Multiple optional bindings can now appear in a single `if` statement
  as a comma-separated list of assignment expressions.
  For more information, see <doc:TheBasics#Optional-Binding>.
- An <doc:Expressions#Optional-Chaining-Expression>
  must appear within a postfix expression.
- Protocol casts are no longer limited to `@objc` protocols.
- Type casts that can fail at runtime
  now use the `as?` or `as!` operator,
  and type casts that are guaranteed not to fail use the `as` operator.
  For more information, see <doc:Expressions#Type-Casting-Operators>.

**2014-10-16**

- Updated for Swift 1.1.
- Added a full guide to <doc:Initialization#Failable-Initializers>.
- Added a description of <doc:Protocols#Failable-Initializer-Requirements>
  for protocols.
- Constants and variables of type `Any` can now contain
  function instances. Updated the example in <doc:TypeCasting#Type-Casting-for-Any-and-AnyObject>
  to show how to check for and cast to a function type
  within a `switch` statement.
- Enumerations with raw values
  now have a `rawValue` property rather than a `toRaw()` method
  and a failable initializer with a `rawValue` parameter
  rather than a `fromRaw()` method.
  For more information, see <doc:Enumerations#Raw-Values>
  and <doc:Declarations#Enumerations-with-Cases-of-a-Raw-Value-Type>.
- Added a new reference section about
  <doc:Declarations#Failable-Initializers>,
  which can trigger initialization failure.
- Custom operators can now contain the `?` character.
  Updated the <doc:LexicalStructure#Operators> reference to describe
  the revised rules.
  Removed a duplicate description of the valid set of operator characters
  from <doc:AdvancedOperators#Custom-Operators>.

**2014-08-18**

- New document that describes Swift 1.0,
  Apple’s new programming language for building iOS and OS X apps.
- Added a new section about
  <doc:Protocols#Initializer-Requirements> in protocols.
- Added a new section about <doc:Protocols#Class-Only-Protocols>.
- <doc:TheBasics#Assertions-and-Preconditions> can now use string interpolation.
  Removed a note to the contrary.
- Updated the
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Concatenating-Strings-and-Characters> section
  to reflect the fact that `String` and `Character` values
  can no longer be combined with the addition operator (`+`)
  or addition assignment operator (`+=`).
  These operators are now used only with `String` values.
  Use the `String` type's `append(_:)` method
  to append a single `Character` value onto the end of a string.
- Added information about the `availability` attribute to
  the <doc:Attributes#Declaration-Attributes> section.
- <doc:TheBasics#Optionals> no longer implicitly evaluate to
  `true` when they have a value and `false` when they do not,
  to avoid confusion when working with optional `Bool` values.
  Instead, make an explicit check against `nil`
  with the `==` or `!=` operators
  to find out if an optional contains a value.
- Swift now has a <doc:BasicOperators#Nil-Coalescing-Operator>
  (`a ?? b`), which unwraps an optional's value if it exists,
  or returns a default value if the optional is `nil`.
- Updated and expanded
  the <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Comparing-Strings> section
  to reflect and demonstrate that string and character comparison
  and prefix / suffix comparison are now based on
  Unicode canonical equivalence of extended grapheme clusters.
- You can now try to set a property's value, assign to a subscript,
  or call a mutating method or operator through
  <doc:OptionalChaining>.
  The information about
  <doc:OptionalChaining#Accessing-Properties-Through-Optional-Chaining>
  has been updated accordingly,
  and the examples of checking for method call success in
  <doc:OptionalChaining#Calling-Methods-Through-Optional-Chaining>
  have been expanded to show how to check for property setting success.
- Added a new section about
  <doc:OptionalChaining#Accessing-Subscripts-of-Optional-Type>
  through optional chaining.
- Updated the <doc:CollectionTypes#Accessing-and-Modifying-an-Array> section
  to note that you can no longer append a single item to an array
  with the `+=` operator.
  Instead, use the `append(_:)` method,
  or append a single-item array with the `+=` operator.
- Added a note that the start value `a`
  for the <doc:BasicOperators#Range-Operators> `a...b` and `a..<b`
  must not be greater than the end value `b`.
- Rewrote the <doc:Inheritance> chapter
  to remove its introductory coverage of initializer overrides.
  This chapter now focuses more on the addition of
  new functionality in a subclass,
  and the modification of existing functionality with overrides.
  The chapter's example of
  <doc:Inheritance#Overriding-Property-Getters-and-Setters>
  has been rewritten to show how to override a `description` property.
  (The examples of modifying an inherited property's default value
  in a subclass initializer have been moved to
  the <doc:Initialization> chapter.)
- Updated the
  <doc:Initialization#Initializer-Inheritance-and-Overriding> section
  to note that overrides of a designated initializer
  must now be marked with the `override` modifier.
- Updated the <doc:Initialization#Required-Initializers> section
  to note that the `required` modifier is now written before
  every subclass implementation of a required initializer,
  and that the requirements for required initializers
  can now be satisfied by automatically inherited initializers.
- Infix <doc:AdvancedOperators#Operator-Methods> no longer require
  the `@infix` attribute.
- The `@prefix` and `@postfix` attributes
  for <doc:AdvancedOperators#Prefix-and-Postfix-Operators>
  have been replaced by `prefix` and `postfix` declaration modifiers.
- Added a note about the order in which
  <doc:AdvancedOperators#Prefix-and-Postfix-Operators> are applied
  when both a prefix and a postfix operator are applied to
  the same operand.
- Operator functions for
  <doc:AdvancedOperators#Compound-Assignment-Operators> no longer use
  the `@assignment` attribute when defining the function.
- The order in which modifiers are specified when defining
  <doc:AdvancedOperators#Custom-Operators> has changed.
  You now write `prefix operator` rather than `operator prefix`,
  for example.
- Added information about the `dynamic` declaration modifier
  in <doc:Declarations#Declaration-Modifiers>.
- Added information about how type inference works
  with <doc:LexicalStructure#Literals>.
- Added more information about curried functions.
- Added a new chapter about <doc:AccessControl>.
- Updated the <doc:StringsAndCharacters> chapter
  to reflect the fact that Swift's `Character` type now represents
  a single Unicode extended grapheme cluster.
  Includes a new section on
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Extended-Grapheme-Clusters>
  and more information about
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Unicode-Scalar-Values>
  and <doc:StringsAndCharacters#Comparing-Strings>.
- Updated the <doc:StringsAndCharacters#String-Literals> section
  to note that Unicode scalars inside string literals
  are now written as `\u{n}`,
  where `n` is a hexadecimal number between 0 and 10FFFF,
  the range of Unicode's codespace.
- The `NSString` `length` property is now mapped onto
  Swift's native `String` type as `utf16Count`, not `utf16count`.
- Swift's native `String` type no longer has
  an `uppercaseString` or `lowercaseString` property.
  The corresponding section in
  <doc:StringsAndCharacters>
  has been removed, and various code examples have been updated.
- Added a new section about
  <doc:Initialization#Initializer-Parameters-Without-Argument-Labels>.
- Added a new section about
  <doc:Initialization#Required-Initializers>.
- Added a new section about <doc:Functions#Optional-Tuple-Return-Types>.
- Updated the <doc:TheBasics#Type-Annotations> section to note that
  multiple related variables can be defined on a single line
  with one type annotation.
- The `@optional`, `@lazy`, `@final`, and `@required` attributes
  are now the `optional`, `lazy`, `final`, and `required`
  <doc:Declarations#Declaration-Modifiers>.
- Updated the entire book to refer to `..<` as
  the <doc:BasicOperators#Half-Open-Range-Operator>
  (rather than the “half-closed range operator”).
- Updated the <doc:CollectionTypes#Accessing-and-Modifying-a-Dictionary>
  section to note that `Dictionary` now has
  a Boolean `isEmpty` property.
- Clarified the full list of characters that can be used
  when defining <doc:AdvancedOperators#Custom-Operators>.
- `nil` and the Booleans `true` and `false` are now <doc:LexicalStructure#Literals>.
- Swift's `Array` type now has full value semantics.
  Updated the information about <doc:CollectionTypes#Mutability-of-Collections>
  and <doc:CollectionTypes#Arrays> to reflect the new approach.
  Also clarified the assignment and copy behavior for strings arrays and dictionaries.
- <doc:CollectionTypes#Array-Type-Shorthand-Syntax> is now written as
  `[SomeType]` rather than `SomeType[]`.
- Added a new section about <doc:CollectionTypes#Dictionary-Type-Shorthand-Syntax>,
  which is written as `[KeyType: ValueType]`.
- Added a new section about <doc:CollectionTypes#Hash-Values-for-Set-Types>.
- Examples of <doc:Closures#Closure-Expressions> now use
  the global `sorted(_:_:)` function
  rather than the global `sort(_:_:)` function,
  to reflect the new array value semantics.
- Updated the information about <doc:Initialization#Memberwise-Initializers-for-Structure-Types>
  to clarify that the memberwise structure initializer is made available
  even if a structure's stored properties don't have default values.
- Updated to `..<` rather than `..`
  for the <doc:BasicOperators#Half-Open-Range-Operator>.
- Added an example of <doc:Generics#Extending-a-Generic-Type>.
